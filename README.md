# IITinder-SoC-21
### Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create an app using Android Studio and Firebase, which will be used for making new connections, making friends, casual dating and project collaboration. It will be a blend of Facebook and Tinder. This will help IITB students, especially introverts. The duration of this project is around 8 weeks. Process includes learning and implementing simultaneously. Ideally, the app would end up boosting social interaction once the college reopens.
