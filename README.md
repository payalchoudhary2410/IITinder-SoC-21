# IITinder-SoC-21
### Project Description:

It will be a blend of Facebook and Tinder. This will help IITB students, especially introverts. The duration of this project is around 8 weeks. Process includes learning and implementing simultaneously. Ideally, the app would end up boosting social interaction once the college reopens.
